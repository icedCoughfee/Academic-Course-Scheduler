The very rough “Classes” class is up and working, with limited functionality. 
When the class is created you will need to use the file name of the txt file you want to implement as a parameter. 
There's an example of this in the main function in the 'ScheduleSys.cpp' file. 
This will let us easily import multiple quarter schedules later on.

While its importing all the info fine, the only function you can call right now is printScheduleTerminal(), 
which prints all the information its imported to the terminal. Go ahead and test it if you want to double-check my work.
The schedule txt file has changed drastically, and is very specific to this code.

*lexicon note: For the purposes of this project I'm referring to school class types as 'courses' and the individual classes we go to as 'classes'. 
So “I&C Sci 10” is a course that offers a single class at 12:30PM. Also note that for this database I'm using military time.

I'll need your input on what other functions I should implement in this class, and how soon we need them. 
So far I'm planning the following:
   functions that will pass courses and classes offered
   functions that will pass courses offered within time constraints
   a function that will take a student object and a course code, then return whether or not that student is eligible to take that class
   many different printing options, to both terminal and external txt files.

So let me know what you'll need on your end, and what you think this project's structure should look like. 
Sorry I didn't use any of the files you put up Brent, I'm better with a more basic structure. 
My code compiles fine with gcc, but let me know if you have any problems. 
I use the command “g++ ScheduleSys.cpp Classes.cpp” to compile.

I got to go eat.
